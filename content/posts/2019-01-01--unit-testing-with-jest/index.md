If testing is optional in development, then bugging is a requirement in production!

# Why testing?

At the beginning of my development career, I want my code to work as fast as possible.
What I can think in the head is pass during development, at that time I decided not to write a test, even simple test.
I usually believe in myself, but now it's different.

Not to write test force me re-test everything manually when I implement new feature or fix a bug, that's not a good expirement.
