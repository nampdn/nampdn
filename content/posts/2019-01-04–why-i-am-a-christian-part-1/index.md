# Getting Started 

When I was 9, while sitting on a chair in the school, I have a sneaky look at some dogs were running outside, I was asking myself: "Why those dogs can run freely out there? Who am I? Why I'm sitting here to study what I don't think I will need?".

All these questions still asking me from time to time, I don't know why I have to live, why I have to obey my parents, why I have to pray with Buddha...

# Getting Lost

Despite the confusion of the life, I just want to do what I want. 

My parents had been broken when I was 5, I live with my single mom for another 5 years before I start to leave home. She sent me to the city to live and study in a non relative family which I don't know who they are.

All of my questions leave me from there too, I started to play online game when I live without parents's guidance. Day by day, all of my mind are filled up with virtual characters. I didn't get my life purpose, my parents didn't get it, including my teachers...
